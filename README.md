# A Simple Statistics Library

## Run tests

Simply run `sbt test`.

For a test run with logs run `sbt test > test.log`.


## IntelliJ

IntelliJ does not support referencing to the shared directory. But this is just the IDE. The compiler understands the shared code. So it works as it is supposed to.
